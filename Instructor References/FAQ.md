# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is CM Clash?

Coding Mind Clash is a supplementary activity for Python that you can use for your students. It is particularly designed for students that are not finding much enjoyment out of coding in Python.

CM Clash is a coding video game in the same vein as CodeCombat, where students will program their own fighting robot in an arena. They can add on modules like guns, swords, claws, and magnets, and upgrade the robot to become the ultimate champion.

You can access CM Clash at [https://clash.codingmind.com/](https://clash.codingmind.com/).

## How do I use this curriculum?

This is not a full blown curriculum, but a supplementary curriculum to be used alongside Python 1, Python 2. This curriculum can be used to a fuller extent if the student seems distracted or unhappy, or in a summer or winter camp.

This curriculum contains 20 exercises that guide the user into how to develop more complex robots. By the end, the student will have learned crucial concepts and techniques that they can apply to their own robots.

## My student finished all of the robots in the curriculum. What do I do?

The exercises are just suggestions on how to program the robot. Afterwards, you can have the student brainstorm their own behavior for the robot and attempt to code it.

## What if my student wants to do something that isn't covered in here?

There is a CM Clash documentation page that is accessible in game or [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbPfSOdWo_Q0EDyMaGaLhTY3TKBqJCXbVZmNKqD5k5A/edit#heading=h.ru0ykummmrsh). You can see all variables and functions available and determine how best to implement their desired behavior.

Feel free to experiment and explore various approaches with your student. The fun in CM Clash comes from experimentation.

## Can a student control a robot with their keyboard?

Because the principal goal of CM Clash is to have a robot's behavior be defined entirely through code, robots are supposed to move based on a student's programming skill, not their mechanical keyboard skill. Keyboard based control is **not** a planned design consideration.
