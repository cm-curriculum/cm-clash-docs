# Robot 20: Chases When Healthy, Flees and Shoots When Hurt

This robot will have 3 different behaviors depending on its health.

- If it's considered "healthy", it chases nearby players with a sword.
- If it's considered "hurt", it runs away from nearby players and shoots at them instead.
- If it's considered "critically hurt", it collects items.

We'll let you consider "healthy", "hurt", and "critically hurt" mean. If during any of these states it can't find anything nearby, then it can just wander around.
