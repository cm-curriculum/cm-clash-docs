# Robot 2: Wandering

Let's actually start moving this time. The `wander()` function will make our robot move randomly around. This is a vital function that you should use in the arena, especially later on, when your robot doesn't have anything better to do.

This is the start of you seeing functions and variables in CM Clash that you normally can't use in Python. There are a lot of them. CM Clash has a lot of information and behaviors available to you that you can access with Python.

```python
def robot():
    wander()
```
