# Robot 8: Attack, Collect, Wander

Now that you also know how to attack people, and how to collect items, you can make a robot that does both.

However, be mindful of priorities. If there's a player nearby and an item nearby, which one would you go for first? How would you program it to reflect that behavior?

Remember to figure out something to do if you don't find any players or items around.
