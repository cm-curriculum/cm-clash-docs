# Robot 19: Runs From Healthy Players

This robot will be more selective with its targets. You may notice that when you are fighting sword to sword with some robots, it's pretty neck-and-neck. In other words, you do generally the same amount of damage to your enemy as they do to you. So, it's not a good idea to fight against a robot with higher health. You'll probably die first.

So, this robot will only chase after enemies with health lower than your own, and flees from anyone with a higher health.
