# Robot 12: Find Health When Hurt

## Health

Of course you know that you have health in CM Clash, given that you've died at least 5 times already. If you want to track how much health you have, you can use the `health` variable. Your health goes from 0 to 100.

## Goal

For this robot, let's say that we just wander around like normal, until we have less than 50 health. If so, keep wandering around, but you will now automatically go for any nearby healing items until you heal back up.
