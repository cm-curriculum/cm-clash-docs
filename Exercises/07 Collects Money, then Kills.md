# Robot 7: Collects Money, then Kills

Now that we know how to kill players, let's make a robot that does something more complicated than just chase people.

This robot will combine our previous two robots into one. It will first collect some desired amount of coins for you, and once it's first mission is complete, it will switch to being aggressive, and chasing after players. Hopefully, you'll be able to get maybe 500 coins at the start, and then bonus coins on top when your robot starts killing other robots.
