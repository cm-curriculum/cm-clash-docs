# Basic Guide

This guide is a documentation form of the tutorial already present within the CM Clash web game.

## The Home Screen

On the home screen, you are presented with your cute little robot in the center, and some options on where to go.

- The **laptop** leads you to the **code editor**.
- The **shop icon** to the left leads you to the **shop**.
- The **bucket of parts** leads you to the **parts editor**.
- The **sword** starts the arena.
- The **stack of books** leads you to the documentation page (for programming).
- The **cogwheel** leads you to the settings menu.

## The Shop

The shop is where you can buy modules like claws, magnets, swords, and guns for your robot, as well as some cool skins for your robot as well. Check out what kind of skins you want the most and grind for them!

## The Parts Editor

The parts editor is where you can configure the modules on your robot by dragging and dropping modules onto it. You start off with 2 claws.

## The Code Editor

The code editor is where you'll be programming the logic center in your fighting robot. The left hand side will display variables and functions exclusive to CM Craft that we will cover as this sub-curriculum continues.

## The Arena

The arena is where you actually do the fighting! Here, you are placed into a battlefield full of coins and players. How long can you make it? You'll get paid handsomely every run that you do, and can use those coins in the shop for more parts or more skins.
